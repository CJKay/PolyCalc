PolyCalc
========

A Javascript-based CSS3 calc() polyfill

Update:
I am no longer maintaining this project.
It has hit a point in the web where I believe it is nearly a requirement to have an up-to-date browser, and naturally a browser that now natively supports the calc() function. I will, however, happily transfer ownership to anybody who wishes to continue to update PolyCalc.
